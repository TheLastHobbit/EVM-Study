**Foundry is a smart contract development toolchain.**

Foundry manages your **dependencies**, **compiles** your project, runs **tests**, **deploys**, and lets you interact with the chain from the **command-line** and via Solidity **scripts**.

## Tools:

1. [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/) is a command-line tool that ships with Foundry. Forge tests, builds, and deploys your smart contracts
2. [Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) is Foundry's command-line tool for performing Ethereum RPC calls. You can make smart contract calls, send transactions, or retrieve any type of chain data - all from your command-line!
3. [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry. You can use it for testing your contracts from frontends or for interacting over RPC.
